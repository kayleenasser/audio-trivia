# Audio Trivia
## Magnet Forensics Hackathon
### By Ari Rubin, Emily Tang, Kaylee Nasser, and Raven Sim

Build an application that takes a folder of audio files (or other source) and plays a random file at a random timestamp for a specified interval and allows you to guess the name of the file (or other success criteria).

Could be used for guessing music, my encyclopedic knowledge of Avatar the Last Airbender episodes, or even language learning: import foreign media files and use it for listening practice!

Bonus points if we could import subtitle tracks and display the subtitle of that timestamp as part of the answer.
